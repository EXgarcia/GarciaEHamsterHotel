SO when going thru it I noticed how organized the code was because when makeing website, you can get lost very easy in it because there is so much stuff that we use from bootsrap, it's just a jungle if you dont know what your looking for. When i went into inpect I start of with latop size and im pretty sure everybody elses looks grat at that point because thats where started off at. Next It was time to move on to tablet size, than mobile. But for the most part everthing looked okay but there was some stuff he could of done if he had more time, but other than that he did a great job.
